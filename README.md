ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rock Kennedy. On most sites I use the name rockum, but that was taken so here I am rockumk.


ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Music Technology.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Lua.

ğŸ“« How to reach me...
   Can you message me here? You can try contacting me at rockum@aol.com, but frankly the account is so filled 
   with junk mail I can't be reliably reached there.

rockumk/rockumk is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
