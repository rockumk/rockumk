👋 Hi, I’m Rock Kennedy. On most sites I use the name Rockum, but that was taken so here I am rockumk.


👀 I’m interested in Music Technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning Lua.

📫 How to reach me...
   Can you message me here? You can try contacting me at rockum@aol.com, but frankly the account is so filled 
   with junk mail I can't be reliably reached there.
